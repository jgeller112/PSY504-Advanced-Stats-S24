## Structural Equation Modeling

-   Surprise!

-- - Regression on steroids

-   Model many relationships at once, rather than run single regressions

-   Model variables that exist (manifest) and those that don't technically exist (latent factors)!

## Specifying a path model

-   You draw it!

-   Each variable you measure is drawn in a rectangle or circle

-   The variables are connected through unidirectional and bidirectional arrows

## Concepts

-   Latent variables

    -   Represented by circles
    -   Abstract phenomena you are trying to model
    -   Are not represented by a number in the dataset
    -   Linked to the measured variables
    -   Represented indirectly by those variables

## Concepts

-   Manifest or observed variables

    -   Represented by squares
    -   Measured from participants, business data, or other sources
    -   While most measured variables are continuous, you can use categorical and ordered measures as well

## Concepts

-   Exogenous
    -   These are synonymous with independent variables
    -   They are thought to be the cause of something.
    -   You can find these in a model where the arrow is leaving the variable
    -   Exogenous (only) variables do not have an error term
    -   Changes in these variables are represented by something else you aren't modeling (like age, gender, etc.)

## Concepts

-   Endogenous
    -   These are synonymous with dependent variables
    -   They are caused by the exogenous variables
    -   In a model diagram, the arrow will be coming into the variable
    -   Endogenous variables have error terms (assigned automatically by the software)

## Concepts

-   Remember that `Y ~ X +` $\epsilon$
-   Here that is `Endogenous ~ Exogenous + Residual`
-   Sometimes people call residuals: *disturbances*

## Concepts

-   Variances, covariances, and disturbances

    -   Exogenous variables all have variance
    -   Exogenous variables may be correlated with each other
        -   Covariace paths
    -   Endogenous variables are probably caused by variables that you did not consider
        -   **disturbances**


## Covariance paths

![](covariancepath.png){fig-align="center"}

## Covariance meaning

![](covarmeaning.png){fig-align="center"}

## Disturbances

![](disturb.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Probably caused by variables that you did not consider

-   Every endogenous variable has a disturbance

## Why is it just regression?

-   Each endogenous variable is regressed on all exogenous variables that are connected in the chain that leads directly to it.

## Limitations

-   Model identification

    -   You cannot test all models

    -   Unique solution

-   If not identified, cannot analyze model

-   How is this determined?

## Minimum condition of identification

-   There must be at least as many known values in the model as there are free parameters

-   Free parameters

    -   All paths, all co-variances, all variances, and all disturbances

    -   Number of known values = (K (K+1))/2 where k is number of measured variables

## Identification

-   Math example

    -   10=2x+y

    -   2 = x-y

        -   2 known and 2 unknowns

        -   One set of values that can solve the equation

-   Cant test other models

## Identification

-   10=2x+y

-   2 = x-y

-   5 = x + 2y

```         
![](ident.png)
```

## Model ID and DF

-   Model DFs

    -   Additional pathways you can estimate
    -   Model DF = (known values) - (free params)
    -   If model DF \>=1 you can analyze model

## Just-Identifed Model

-   DF = 0

    -   You can analyze the model

    -   But:

        -   Fits data perfectly
        -   Ignore fit indices \## How to do it

1.  Specify model
2.  Make sure it is identified
3.  Run the model
4.  Interpret output
5.  Report results

## Model specification

-   Think up all the constructs that are relevant to model
-   Consider how they are connected
-   Justify each path that is present and absent

## Example Data

-   What makes someone apply to graduate school?

-   MEASURE ATTITUDES, MOTIVATION, AND BEHAVIOURS AMONG 60 4TH-YEAR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS

-   DV:

    -   Intent to apply

-   IV:

    -   Perceived value
    -   external pressure
    -   perceived control over admission

```{r}

grad <- read.csv(here::here("data", "graduate.school.csv"))
```

## Model

![](model.png){fig-align="center"}

## Identification

![](check_id.png){fig-align="center"}

## Run SEM in R 

```{r}
library(lavaan)
```

1.  Declare equations for every endogenous variable in your model

2.  Name paths by multiplying the predictor

3.  Calculate indirect effects

```{r}
grad_model = '
intent.to.apply~a*perceived.value+b*external.pressure+c*perceived.control 

    application.behaviour~d*intent.to.apply+perceived.control

    #indirect
    value.through.intent:=a*d
    #indirect
    pressure.through.intent:=b*d  
    control.through.intent:=c*d '

```

```{r}
fit <- summary(grad_model, se="bootstrap", fit.measures=TRUE, standardized=TRUE, data=grad)
```

## Run the model


## Model fit

![](modfit.png){fig-align="center"}

## Model fit

-   $\chi^2$ or SRMR

    -   Measures how well data fits model

-   RMSEA

    -   Measure how much worse the data fit the model from the just identified model

-   Relative goodness of fit

CFI or TLI

-   Measures how much better the model fits than the null model (all paths=0)

## Reporting Results

-   Make reference to a figure with your hypothesized model and paramter estimates and report model fit.

The hypothesized model was tested with path analysis and the estimated model is  depicted in Figure 1. The model appeared to have good fit, SRMR = .02, RMSEA= 0, 90% CI \[0, 0.20\], CFI = 1.

## Reporting results

\- Describe significance of the paths

The perceived value of graduate education predicted intentions to apply to grad school, *β* = 0.81, *Z* = 7.21, *p* \< 0.01, but intentions to apply to grad school were not significantly predicted by external pressure to go to grad school, *β* = 0.10, *Z* =  0.97, *p* = 0.33, or perceived control over the outcome of graduate admissions, *β* =-0.13, *Z* = -1.11, *p* =.27. However, intention to go to grad school significantly predicted actually applying, *β* = 0.35, *Z* = 2.94, *p* \< 0.01, and so did perceived  control over the outcome of graduate admissions, *β* = 0.34, *Z* = 2.83, *p* = 0.01.

## Visualize model 
![](path_model.png)

## Visualize model

## Best practices

-   Constraining paths

    -   In SEM you can explciity test hypotheses about the size of specific paths

        -   contrain a path to certin value

        -   constrain two paths to be equal

        -   compare model fit of models with constrained and uncontrained paths

## Contraining paths

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](contrained.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}

grad_model_constrained = '  intent.to.apply~a*perceived.value+0*external.pressure+c*perceived.control  
application.behaviour~d*intent.to.apply+perceived.control  
value.through.intent:=a*d	
control.through.intent:=c*d'

grad_analysis_constrained =  grad_model_constrained %>% sem(data=grad)

#anova(fit, #grad_analysis_constrained)
