# Population Paramter Estimate

We saw last semester: 

- Best estimate of a population mean 

$$ \mu = \bar X$$

- Estimate of sd of sampling distribution of means is the standard error of mean

$$ SE_{mean} = \frac{s_x}{\sqrt(n)}$$
- We can use this to generate 95% CIs

$$ \bar X +- t_{\alpha}(s_{\bar X})$$
---
# Bias

- Extreme scores and non-normality can bias our results

  - Bias population parameters:
  
    - $\mu$ 
    - $\sigma_2$ 
    - $SE_M$ 
  
- What can we do to reduce it?

# Bootstrapping Pros

1. You can use it to determine the probability of observing values of variables that come from any distribution

  - Including times when you have no clue which distribution describes your variable and you don’t even want to guess

  - Including distributions that are not currently “known” to science

---

2. The lack of assumptions about a variable’s distribution makes the bootstrapped probability estimates more accurate

  - Far better than trying to pigeon-hole data into a distribution that doesn’t describe them

3. Minimizes the influence of outliers without trivializing the inferential value of them (when using robust estimators)

---
# Bootstrapping Cons

- It can be time intensive

  - You can use Princeton HPC servers
  
    - RStudio Cloud  
---  
# Permutation Tests

- Permutation tests

  - Extension of bootstrapping when you want to test hypotheses
  
  - Does not rely on classical probability distributions

- Find statistic of interest
  
$$H_0$$ = Drug has no effect

$$H_1$$ = Drug has an effect

  - Simulate the null

    - Exchangeability (randomly sampling)
    
      - Shuffle conditions 
  
  - Do it many times

    - How many times did you  get a test statistic as large or larger? 
    
---
# Demonstration

```{r}

knitr::include_url("https://www.jwilber.me/permutationtest/")


```
---
# Permutation Test Pros

- ** Makes very limited assumptions about distribution**
---
# Permutation Test Cons

1. Permutation tests are inefficient compared to asymptotic tests. When you have only a few observations, it might be impossible to control alpha at the level you want and still do a permutation test

2. You have to assume that both samples have the exact same distribution (same shape, center, and spread) not just the same value for one parameter 

3. A permutation test assumes that the only difference between the two groups is the random assignment

4. Permutation tests can be intensive (depending on design)

# Example Data

- Research Question: 

  - Are smaller chillies hotter than longer chillies?
  
  - Pepper Joe measured the length and heat of 85 chillies peppers
  
- DV 

  - Heat of each chili (0-11)
  
- IV 

  - Length of each Chili

```{r}
library(boot)
library(simpleboot)

chili<- fread("/Users/jasongeller/Documents/03-Robust_Methods/data/chillis.csv")

# Challenge

Data: chillis.csv

- Task:

  - Create a function to run regression 
  
  - Bootstrap a regression predicting chilli heat from length

- Use 10,000 bootstraps

- Choose and use a random seed

- Calculate BCa CIs
---
# Report Bootstrap

- We hypothesized that the length of a chilli was related to its hotness. We chose to bootstrap the distributions of model parameters to account for any deviations from normality in the data. We ran 10,000 bootstrap resamples for each parameter with a random seed of 237846 using the boot package (Canty & Ripley, 2017) in R 4.0.4 (R Core Team, 2020). The estimates for all parameters are provided in Table 1. Relevant to our hypothesis, the median value for the influence of length on hotness was -.15, 95% CI [-0.27, -0.08]. This interval does not include 0, which, when taken with the sign of the slope, suggests that shorter chillies are hotter.
---
# Hypothesis Testing - Two Sample

- Simulate the null hypothesis (that drug and control labels are random)

  - Throw both groups into a bucket
  
  - Randomly reconstitute the two groups, disregarding their original group membership (**EXCHANGABILITY**)  
  
  - *(Resample without replacement)*
  
  - Recompute the statistic of interest
