## Lab 1: Multilevel Modeling

For this lab, we will apply core concepts of multilevel modeling to a dataset from Coyne et al. (2019). Here, you will be engaging in model building/selection, fitting and interpreting results, and visualizing results. This lab is meant to be an introduction to the techniques of multilevel modeling.
