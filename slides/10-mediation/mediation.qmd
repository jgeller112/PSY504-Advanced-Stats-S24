## Today

-   Testing mediation in R

    -   Classical approach to testing mediation (Baron and Kenny)

    -   Joint significance

    -   Sobel

    -   Bootstrapped approach to testing mediation (preferred approach)

## Is mediation f\*\*\*ed?

-   Mediation is a hard causal inference task!

    -   Manipulation of and random assignment of X affords causal inference/causal claims

        -   However, we often do not do the for M

            -   Mediation analysis requires theory and subsequent experiments to test mediator

## Mediation: Example

-   Does study time mediate the relationship between Facebook usage and exam scores?

    -   Implying that the overuse of Facebook prevents people from studying, so they do differently on their exam

# Testing Mediation

## Causal Steps - Baron & Kenny (1986)

-   Mediation is tested through three regression models:

::: panel-tabset
## Regression 1

-   Predicting the outcome from the predictor variable
-   X -\> Y
-   c path : total effect

## Regression 2

-   Predicting the mediator from the predictor variable

-   X -\> M

-   a path

## Regression 3

-   Predicting the outcome from both the predictor variable and the mediator

-   X+M→Y

-   b path

-   c' (c-prime) path: direct effect
:::

## Mediation Paths

![](images/IMG_4157.JPG){fig-align="center"}

| Paths                                                      |                                                |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| c: "total effect" of X on Y                                | Total effect = direct effect + indirect effect |
| a x b = "indirect effect" of X on Y (our mediation effect) | indirect effect = total effect - direct effect |
| $c^\prime$ = "direct effect" of X on Y                     |                                                |

## Why take the product of the two coefficients?

![](images/IMG_0B66D4765F33-1.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

-   An intuitive explanation:

    -   A 1 unit increase in M corresponds to a b unit increase in Y holding X constant

        -   How much does X change M?

            -   a

-   So if **a = 1/2**, X changes M by 1/2, which then changes Y by b, the indirect effect is **(1/2) × b**

## Causal Steps - Baron & Kenny (1986)

-   Traditionally, to show mediation ALL these conditions must be met:

    -   X must significantly predict Y in Step 1

    -   X must significantly predict M in Step 2

    -   M must significantly predict Y controlling for X in Step 3

    -   The effect of X on Y must be reduced in Step 4

        -   If X is no longer significant, you have "full mediation"

        -   If X is still significant, then you have "partial mediation"

            -   Not really used in anymore

## Mediation: c path

```{r}

model1 <- lm(exam ~ facebook, data = master)

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| 
model_parameters(model1, digit=3) %>%
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 24) %>%
 row_spec(2, color = "white",
              background = "red")
```

-   The c path (total effect): X --\> Y:

    $b = -0.66, t(237) = -5.16, 95\% CI[-0.91, -0.41], p < .001$

## Mediation: a path

```{r}

model2 <- lm(previous ~ facebook, data = master)

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| 
model_parameters(model2, digit=3) %>%
    kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 24) %>%
 row_spec(2, color = "white",
              background = "red")

```

-   The a path: X --\> M:

    $b = -0.21, t(237) = -2.16, 95\% CI[-0.40, -0.02], p = .031$

## Mediation: b, c' path

-   Add in the b (M --\> Y) and c' **(direct)** paths: X + M --\> Y

```{r}
model3 <- lm(exam ~ facebook + previous, data = master)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#|
model_parameters(model3, digits=3) %>% 
kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 24) %>%
 row_spec(2:3, color = "white",
              background = "red")

```

-   c' Path: $b = -0.61, t(237) = -4.77, 95\% CI[-0.86, -0.36], p < .001$

-   b Path: $b = 0.26, t(237) = 3.09, 95\% CI[0.09, 0.42], p = .002$

## Mediation: interpretation

-   Facebook usage negatively impacts exam scores (c path = -.66)

-   Facebook usage negatively impacts previous study time (a path = -.21)

-   Controlling for Facebook time, previous study time positively impacts exam scores (b path = .26)

-   Controlling for previous study time, Facebook usage negatively impacts exam scores (c' path = -0.61)

. . .

-   Do we have mediation here?

## Issues with causal steps

. . .

-   Indirect effect is inferred rather than directly estimated

. . .

-   Failure to meet a criterion results in game over!

. . .

-   If total effect (path c) is not statistically significant, game does not begin

## Joint significance test

-   An edited version of causal steps approach

    -   If a path and b path are significant

        -   Mediation!

-   Some issues:

    -   Indirect effect is inferred rather than directly estimated

    -   Failure to meet a criterion results in game over!

## Testing mediation: Sobel test

-   So, did mediation happen? Is a change from 0.66 to 0.61 important?

-   The Sobel Test:

    $$Z = \frac{a \times b}{\sqrt{b^2 \times SE_a^2 + a^2 \times SE_b^2}}$$

    -   If the indirect effect is larger than the error, we would conclude that the addition of the M variable changed the c path

## Sobel Test

```{r}
#sobel
a <- coef(model2)[2]
b <- coef(model3)[3]
SEa <- summary(model2)$coefficients[2,2]
SEb <- summary(model3)$coefficients[3,2]
zscore <- (a*b)/(sqrt((b^2*SEa^2)+(a^2*SEb^2)))
zscore
#two tailed test 
pnorm(abs(zscore), lower.tail = F)*2

```

## Sobel test

```{r}
library(bda)
#conducts sobel test
mediation.test(master$previous,master$facebook,master$exam)
```

-   *Z* = -1.77, *p* = .08

    -   *We would conclude that no mediation had occurred*

::: callout-note
Other tests listed use slightly different denominator formula
:::

## Sobel test

-   Serious problems!

    -   Assumes indirect effect is normally distributed

        -   Not always the case

![](images/IMG_C60929BD11B9-1.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Mediation: Bootstrapping

-   Testing significance of indirect effect (a x b)

    -   Does not assume distribution is normal
    -   More sensitive test = Higher power!

## Mediation: Bootstrapping

-   What it is:

    -   A computer based method for deriving the probability distribution for any random variable

-   When to use it:

    -   You do not know the distribution of your variable(s)

-   How to do it:

    -   Run your analysis a bunch of times with a slightly different set of observations each time

## Bootstrap: Overview

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
1.  Take a random sample of size n from the sample with replacement
2.  Estimate the indirect effect in this “resample”
3.  Repeat (1) and (2) a total of k times, where k is at least 1,000. The larger k, the better. I recommend at least 10,000
4.  Use distribution of the indirect effect over multiple resamples as an approximation of the sampling distribution of the indirect effect
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false


knitr::include_graphics("images/bootstrap.jpg")
```
:::
:::

## The Bootstrapped CI

-   Using the bootstrap sample we can calculate 95% CI

    -   Percentile bootstrap

        -   Find the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of the statistic

-   If 0 is included, no mediation

::: callout-note
Variations exist (e.g., ‘bias corrected’ or ‘bias-corrected and accelerated’ confidence intervals but they do not perform as well as percentile.)
:::

## Mediation: All together + bootstrapping

-   Do it all with one function

    -   The MeMoBootR package (developed by Erin Buchanon) gives you data screening, each step of the mediation, and the bootstrapping results!

        -   The data screening does not include accuracy or missing data, so that should be completed first

```{r}
#| results: hide
#| 
#| 
devtools::install_github("doomlab/MeMoBootR")
#library(MeMoBootR)
#no missing data allowed
med_results <- mediation1(y = "exam",
                          x = "facebook", 
                          m = "previous", nboot = 1000, 
                          df = master)
```

## Assumptions

:::

## Mediation: MeMoBootR

For each of our stages of mediation, you can print out the models:

::: panel-tabset
## Step 1

```{r}
model_parameters(med_results$model1) %>% kable()
```

## Step 2

```{r}

model_parameters((med_results$model2)) %>% kable()
```

## Step 3

```{r}

model_parameters(med_results$model3) %>% kable()
```
:::

## Mediation: MeMoBootR

-   Next, you can get the Sobel test results:

```{r}
med_results$indirect.effect
med_results$z.score
med_results$p.value
```

## Bootstrapping

-   Last, let's get the bootstrapped results:

```{r}
med_results$boot.results
```

-   The indirect effect would be reported as: *b* = 0.05, 95% CI\[-0.147, -0.001\]

-   Returns several type of cis

## Bootstrapping

-   Percentile bootstrap

```{r}
med_results$boot.ci$percent %>% kable()
```

## Within-participant mediation

-   Mediation when X is a within-subject variable

-   Dohle and Siegrist (2014, Exp 1)

    -   Interested in the effect of name complexity on buying drugs

        -   The specific hypothesis is that complex drug names are perceived as more hazardous, which makes someone less likely to buy the drug

## Within-participant mediation

$$
Y_{2i} - Y_{1i} = c_{11}
$$

with $Y2_i$​−$Y1_i$ the difference score between DV conditions for the outcome variable for the *i*th observation

$$
M_{2i}-M_{1i} = a_{21}
$$

with $M_{2i}$​−$M1_{1i}​$ the difference score between DV conditions for the mediator variable for the *i*th observation,

$$Y_{2i} - Y_{1i} = c'_{31} + b_{32}(M_{2i} - M_{1i}) +
  d_{33}[0.5(M_{1i} + M_{2i}) - 0.5(\overline{M_{1} + M_{2}})]$$

## Summary: Mediation

-   What it is: A method for testing hypotheses about why and how x predicts y

-   When you use it:

    -   Whenever you would start using words like "because" in your introduction section

    -   Whether there is a basic relationship between x and y or not

    -   Best approach\*:

        -   Bootstrapping

## Write-up: Simple mediation

-   a, b paths

-   Direct effect (c')
