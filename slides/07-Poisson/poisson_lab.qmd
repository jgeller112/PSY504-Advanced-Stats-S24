-   To complete this lab:

    1\. Download the dataset:

    2010.csv

    2\. Download the

    Preregistration Document

    3\. Conduct the analysis described in the preregistration Document

    4\. Create a new document and save it as a PDF

    -   Report the results of both generalized linear models described in the preregistration document in APA style, each in their own paragraphs

    -   Create a figure for each model by focusing on only one of the predictors in each model (i.e., the one that is most interesting to you)

    -   You may select any predictor from the model that interests you

    -   If you would like some guidance, then I would recommend plotting the estimated marginal means for these specific predictors:

        -   Poisson Model: Plot estimated marginal means of hours per week on the Internet as a function of vocabulary (i.e., +/- 1 SD for the variable WORDSUM)

        -   Negative Binomial Model: Plot number of sexual partner has had in the previous 5 years as a function of marital status (i.e., all the levels of the variable MARITAL)

        5\. Upload your analysis script and html PDF of your report (Results + Figures) to Github
