## Multinomial distribution

-   Extension of Bernoulli and binomial distributions

-   When you have more than two outcomes and fixed number of trials

$$P(X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, \ldots, X_k = x_k) = \frac{n!}{x_1! x_2! \cdots x_k!} p_1^{x_1} p_2^{x_2} \cdots p_k^{x_k}$$

-   $X$ = \# of times events occur
-   $p$ = probability of occurrence
-   $n$ = \# of trials

$$\text{Mean of } X_i = E[X_i] = n \cdot p_i$$$$\text{Variance of } X_i = \text{Var}(X_i) = n \cdot p_i \cdot (1 - p_i)$$

## Multinomial Logistic Regression

-   In ordinal regression:

$$\begin{array}{rcl} L_1 &=& \alpha_1-\beta_1x_1-\cdots-\beta_p X_p\\ L_2 &=& \alpha_2-\beta_1x_1-\cdots-\beta_p X_p & \\ L_{J-1} &=& \alpha_{J-1}-\beta_1x_1-\cdots-\beta_p X_p \end{array}$$

-   In the multinomial logistic model:

$$\begin{array}{rcl} L_1 &=& \alpha_1+\beta_1x_1+\cdots+\beta_p X_p\\ L_2 &=& \alpha_2+\beta_2x_1+\cdots+\beta_p X_p & \\ L_{J-1} &=& \alpha_{J-1}+\beta_jx_1+\cdots+\beta_p X_p \end{array}$$

## Multinomial logistic regression

-   Choose a baseline category. Let's choose $y=0$. Then,

$$P(y_i = 0|x_i) = P_{i0}$$ and $$P(y_i = 1|x_i) = P_{i1}$$

$$\log\bigg(\frac{p_{i1}}{p_{i0}}\bigg) = \beta_{0k} + \beta_{1k} x_i$$

-   Slope: $\beta_1$: when x increases by one unit, the odds of Y = 1 vs. baseline is expected to multiply by a factor or $exp(\beta)$

-   Intercept: $\beta_0$: when x = 0 the odds of Y = 1 is expected to be $exp(\beta)$

## Multinomial Logistic Regression

-   Geller et al.(2018)

    -   Which of the following best describes your pattern of study?

        -   Light cram
        -   Heavy cram
        -   Space out

-   Let "Space out" be the baseline category. Then

$$\log\bigg(\frac{\pi_{light }}{\pi_{space}}\bigg) = \beta_{0B} + \beta_{1B}x_i \\[10pt]
\log\bigg(\frac{\pi_{heavy}}{\pi_{space}}\bigg) = \beta_{0C} + \beta_{1C} x_i$$

## Summary

-   Multinomial logistic regression models the probabilities of j response categories (j-1)

    -   Typically these compare each of the first m-1 categories to the last (reference) category

        -   1 vs. m, 2 vs.m, 3 vs. m

-   Logits for any pair of categories can be calculated from the m-1 fitted ones

## NHANES data

-   [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) is conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)

-   The goal is to *"assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States"*

-   This survey includes an interview and a physical examination

## NHANES data

-   We will use the data from the <font class="vocab">`NHANES`</font> R package

-   Contains 75 variables for the 2009 - 2010 and 2011 - 2012 sample years

-   The data in this package is modified for educational purposes and should **not** be used for research

-   Original data can be obtained from the [NCHS website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/index.htm) for research purposes

-   Type <font class="vocab">`?NHANES`</font> in console to see list of variables and definitions

## Health rating vs. age & physical activity

-   **Question**: Can we use a person's age and whether they do regular physical activity to predict their self-reported health rating?

-   We will analyze the following variables:

    -   <font class="vocab">`HealthGen`: </font>Self-reported rating of participant's health in general. Excellent, Vgood, Good, Fair, or Poor.

    -   <font class="vocab">`Age`: </font>Age at time of screening (in years). Participants 80 or older were recorded as 80.

    -   <font class="vocab">`PhysActive`: </font>Participant does moderate to vigorous-intensity sports, fitness or recreational activities

## The data

```{webr-r}
nhanes_adult <- NHANES %>%
  #only use ages 18+
  filter(Age >= 18) %>%
  #select 4 vars from the full dataset
  dplyr::select(HealthGen, Education, Age, PhysActive)  %>%
  # get rid of nas
  drop_na()

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| 
library(NHANES)
nhanes_adult <- NHANES %>%
  #only use ages 18+
  filter(Age >= 18) %>%
  #select 4 vars from the full dataset
  dplyr::select(HealthGen, Education, Age, PhysActive) %>%
  mutate(PhysActive_yes=relevel(PhysActive, ref="Yes")) %>%
  # get rid of nas
  drop_na() 
```

```{r}
glimpse(nhanes_adult)
```

## Exploratory data analysis

```{r echo = F, fig.align="center", out.width = "50%"}

library(patchwork)

p1 <- ggplot(data = nhanes_adult, aes(x = Age)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Age")
p2 <- ggplot(data = nhanes_adult, aes(x = PhysActive)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Moderate or vigorous sport or exercise")
p3 <- ggplot(data = nhanes_adult, aes(x = HealthGen)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Self-reported rating of overall health")

p3+(p1/p2)

```

## Exploratory data analysis

```{r echo = F,fig.align="center",out.width="80%", fig.width=14, fig.height=8}
p1 <- ggplot(data = nhanes_adult, aes(x = HealthGen, y = Age)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue") + 
  labs(title = "Age vs. Health Rating") +
  coord_flip()
p2 <- ggplot(data = nhanes_adult, aes(x = PhysActive, fill = HealthGen)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(y = "Proportion", 
       title = "Physical Activity vs. Health Rating") 
p1 + p2
```

## Multinomial model in R

-   Use the <font class="vocab">`multinom()`</font> function in the `nnet` package

```{webr-r}
library(nnet)# multinom 

health_m <- multinom(HealthGen ~ PhysActive + Age, 
                     data = nhanes_adult)
summary(health_m)
```

```{r, echo = F, results = "hide"}
library(nnet)# multinom 

health_m <- multinom(HealthGen ~ PhysActive + Age, 
                     data = nhanes_adult)
summary(health_m)
```

## Output results

```{webr-r}
model_parameters(health_m, exponentiate = FALSE)%>%  filter(Response=="Fair") %>%
  kable(digits = 3, format = "markdown")
```

```{webr-r}
model_parameters(health_m, exponentiate = TRUE)%>%  filter(Response=="Fair") %>%
  kable(digits = 3, format = "markdown")
```

## Fair vs. excellent health

The baseline category for the model is `Excellent`

The model equation for the log-odds a person rates themselves as having "Fair" health vs. "Excellent" is

$$\log\Big(\frac{\hat{\pi}_{Fair}}{\hat{\pi}_{Excellent}}\Big) = 1.03  + 0.001 ~ \text{age} - 1.66 ~ \text{PhysActive}$$

## Fair vs. excellent health: Interpretations

$$\log\Big(\frac{\hat{\pi}_{Fair}}{\hat{\pi}_{Excellent}}\Big) = 1.03  + \color{Red} {0.001} ~ \text{age} - 1.66 ~ \text{PhysActive}$$

. . .

-   For each additional year in age, the odds a person rates themselves as having fair health versus excellent health are expected to multiply by `r round(exp(0.001), 3)` (exp(0.001)), holding physical activity constant.

    -   As Age ⬆️, more likely to report Fair vs. Excellent health

## Fair vs. excellent health: Interpretations

$$\log\Big(\frac{\hat{\pi}_{Fair}}{\hat{\pi}_{Excellent}}\Big) = 1.03  + 0.001 ~ \text{age} \color{Red}{- 1.66} ~ \text{PhysActive}$$

. . .

-   The odds a person who does physical activity will rate themselves as having fair health versus excellent health are expected to be `r round(exp(-1.66 ),3)` `(exp(-1.66))` times the odds for a person who doesn't do physical activity, holding age constant.

    -   A person who does physical activity is more likely to rate themselves in Excellent vs. Fair health

## Interpretations

$$\log\Big(\frac{\hat{\pi}_{Fair}}{\hat{\pi}_{Excellent}}\Big) = \color{Red}{1.03}  + 0.001 ~ \text{age} - 1.66 ~ \text{PhysActive}$$

. . .

-   The odds a 0 year old person who doesn't do physical activity rates themselves as having fair health vs. excellent health are `r round(exp(1.03),3)` `(exp(1.03))`.

`r emo::ji("warning")` **Need to mean-center age for the intercept to have a meaningful interpretation!**

## Good vs. Excellent health

```{webr-r}
model_parameters(health_m, exponentiate = FALSE)%>%  filter(Response=="Good") %>%
  kable(digits = 3, format = "markdown")

```

## Good vs. Excellent health

-   Get OR

```{webr-r}
model_parameters(health_m, exponentiate = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(Response=="Good") %>%
  kable(digits = 3, format = "markdown")
```

## Good vs. Excellent health

The baseline category for the model is `Excellent`

The model equation for the log-odds a person rates themselves as having "Good" health vs. "Excellent" is

$$\log\Big(\frac{\hat{\pi}_{Good}}{\hat{\pi}_{Excellent}}\Big) = 1.99  - 0.003   ~ \text{age} - 1.011 ~ \text{PhysActive}$$

## Interpretations

$$\log\Big(\frac{\hat{\pi}_{Good}}{\hat{\pi}_{Excellent}}\Big) = 1.99 \color{Red}{- 0.003}   ~ \text{age} - 1.011 ~ \text{PhysActive}$$

. . .

For each additional year in age, the odds a person rates themselves as having "Good" health versus "Excellent" health are expected to multiply by `r round(exp(-0.003), 3)` (exp(-0.003)), holding physical activity constant

-    As Age ⬆️, higher probability to report excellant health vs. good health

## Interpretations

$$\log\Big(\frac{\hat{\pi}_{Good}}{\hat{\pi}_{Excellent}}\Big) = {1.99}  - 0.003     ~ \text{age} \color{Red}{- 1.011} ~ \text{PhysActive}$$

. . .

-   The odds a person who does physical activity will rate themselves as having "Good" health versus "Excellent" health are expected to be `r round(exp(-1.01),3)` `(exp(-1.01))` times the odds for a person who doesn't do physical activity, holding age constant

    -   A person who does physical activity rate themselves in Excellent vs. good health

## Interpretations

$$\log\Big(\frac{\hat{\pi}_{Good}}{\hat{\pi}_{Excellent}}\Big) = \color{Red}{1.99}  - 0.003  ~ \text{age} - 1.011 ~ \text{PhysActive}$$

. . .

-   The odds a 0 year old person who doesn't do physical activity rates themselves as having Good health vs. Excellent health are `r round(exp(1.99),3)` `(exp(1.99))`.

<!-- -->

-   Those reporting no physical activity are more likely to report Good vs. Excellent health

`r emo::ji("warning")` **Need to mean-center age for the intercept to have a meaningful interpretation!**

## Change baseline

::: callout-important
-   Chosen baseline/reference should be determined a priori
:::

<br> <br>

```{r, eval=FALSE}

nhanes_adult %>%
  mutate(HealthGen = relevel(as.factor(HealthGen), ref= "Poor"))
#relevel modle to change baseline
```

## Model

-   Report LRT with the `anova` function

```{r}

car::Anova(health_m) %>% 
  kable()

```

## Comparisons

-   `emmeans` approach

    -   Log odds (category vs. reference) for the difference between variables (`PhysActive`)

```{webr-r}

multi_an <- emmeans(health_m, ~ PhysActive|HealthGen) # get education 
coefs = contrast(regrid(multi_an, "log"),"trt.vs.ctrl1", by="PhysActive") # make sure logit and response vs. baseline the difference in logs odds is equal to the log of the odds
contrast(coefs, "revpairwise", by = "contrast") %>% kable() # This line performs additional contrasts on the results obtained from the previous step (coefs).

```

## Comparisons

```{r}

multi_an <- emmeans(health_m, ~ PhysActive|HealthGen) # get education 
coefs = contrast(regrid(multi_an, "log"),"trt.vs.ctrl1", by="PhysActive") # make sure logit and response vs. baseline
contrast(coefs, "revpairwise", by = "contrast") %>% kable() # This line performs additional contrasts on the results obtained from the previous step (coefs).

```

## Comparisons

-   For continuous predictors, `emmeans` uses marginal effects at the mean (MEM)

-   We can use `marginaleffects` to get average effect of `Age`

```{r}
avg_slopes(
    health_m,
    hypothesis = "reference",
    variables = c("Age"), 
    type="latent") %>% 
  kable()

```

## NHANES: Predicted probabilities: `PhysActive`

```{r echo = T}
#calculate predicted probabilities
ggemmeans(health_m, terms=c("PhysActive")) %>%
  kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)
```

## Plot predicted probabilities: `PhysActive`

```{r}
#| fig-align: "center"
#| 
 ggemmeans(health_m, terms=c("PhysActive")) %>%   ggplot(., aes(x = x, y = predicted, fill = response.level)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity" ) +
    geom_text(aes(label = round(predicted, 3)), color="white", position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5),size=5)  + 
  easy_add_legend_title("Response") + 
  labs(x="Physical Health", "Predicted Probablity") + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 30)) +  
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) + 
  theme_lucid(base_size=25)

```

## Plot predicted probabilities: `Age`

```{r}
#| fig-align: "center"
#| 
ggpredict(health_m, terms=c("Age")) %>%
ggplot(., aes(x=x, y=predicted, fill=response.level)) + 
    geom_area(alpha=0.6 , size=.5, colour="white") + 
    labs(x="Age", y="Predicted Probablity") + 
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = T) +
   easy_add_legend_title("Response") + 
    theme_lucid(base_size=25)
```

# Model selection

## Add `Education` to the model?

-   We consider adding the participants' `Education` level to the model

    -   Education takes values `8thGrade`, `9-11thGrade`, `HighSchool`, `SomeCollege`, and `CollegeGrad`

-   Models we're testing:

    -   Reduced Model: `Age`, `PhysActive`
    -   Full Model: `Age`, `PhysActive`, `Education`

$$\begin{align}&H_0: \beta_{8thGrade} = \beta_{9-11thGrade} = \beta_{HighSchool} = \beta_{SomeCollege} = \beta_{CollegeGrad} = 0\\
&H_a: \text{ at least one }\beta_j \text{ is not equal to }0\end{align}$$

## Add `Education` to the model?

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
#| message: false
#| 
model_red <- multinom(HealthGen ~ Age + PhysActive, 
               data = nhanes_adult)
model_full <- multinom(HealthGen ~ Age + PhysActive + 
                         Education, 
               data = nhanes_adult)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| results: hide

model_red <- multinom(HealthGen ~ Age + PhysActive, 
               data = nhanes_adult)
model_full <- multinom(HealthGen ~ Age + PhysActive + 
                         Education, 
               data = nhanes_adult)

```

## Add `Education` to the model?

```{r echo = T}
anova(model_red, model_full, test = "Chisq") %>%
  kable(format = "markdown")
```

At least one coefficient associated with `Education` is non-zero. Therefore, we will include `Education` in the model.

## Full model

```{r}

car::Anova(model_full, type="II") %>%
  kable(format = "markdown", digits = 3)

```

## Comparisons

-   Use `emmeans` to extract the log odds coefs for comparisons of interest

```{r}
multi_an <- emmeans(model_full, ~ Education|HealthGen) # get education 
coefs = contrast(regrid(multi_an, "log"),"trt.vs.ctrl1", by="Education") # make sure logit and response vs. baseline
contrast(coefs, "revpairwise", by = "contrast") # This line performs additional contrasts on the results obtained from the previous step (coefs).
```

## Predicted Probabilities: `Education`

```{r}
#| fig-align: "center"

plot_edu <- ggemmeans(model_full, terms=c("Education")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = predicted, fill = response.level))  +  
  geom_bar(stat = "identity" ) + 
   geom_text(aes(label = round(predicted, 3)), color="white", position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5),size=5) + 
  easy_add_legend_title("Response") + 
  labs(x="Education", "Predicted Probablity") + 
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%", fig.retina=4}

plot_edu

```

# Checking Assumptions

## Assumptions for multinomial logistic regression

-   Same assumptions as logistic regression
    -   Fit separate logistic regressions to check for linearity, outliers, and multicollinearity

```{r}

nhanes_adult <- nhanes_adult %>%
  mutate(Excellent = factor(if_else(HealthGen == "Excellent", "1", "0")), 
         Vgood = factor(if_else(HealthGen == "Vgood", "1", "0")), 
         Good = factor(if_else(HealthGen == "Good", "1", "0")), 
         Fair = factor(if_else(HealthGen == "Fair", "1", "0")), 
         Poor = factor(if_else(HealthGen == "Poor", "1", "0"))
  )

# fit sep logistic models

```

```{r}
#| eval: false
performance::check_model()
```

## Model fit
