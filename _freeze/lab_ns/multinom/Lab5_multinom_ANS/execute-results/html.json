You can read more about the survey design and respondents in the README of the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/non-voters) for the data.\n\nRespondents were asked a variety of questions about their political beliefs, thoughts on multiple issues, and voting behavior. We will focus on using the demographic variables and someone's party identification to understand whether a person is a probable voter.\n\nThe variables we'll focus on were (definitions from the codebook in data set GitHub repo):\n\n-   `ppage`: Age of respondent\n\n-   `educ`: Highest educational attainment category.\\\n\n-   `race`: Race of respondent, census categories. Note: all categories except Hispanic were non-Hispanic.\n\n-   `gender`: Gender of respondent\n\n-   `income_cat`: Household income category of respondent\n\n-   `Q30`: Response to the question \"Generally speaking, do you think of yourself as a...\"\n\n    -   1: Republican\n    -   2: Democrat\n    -   3: Independent\n    -   4: Another party, please specify\n    -   5: No preference\n    -   -1: No response\n\n-   `voter_category`: past voting behavior:\n\n    -   **always**: respondent voted in all or all-but-one of the elections they were eligible in\n    -   **sporadic**: respondent voted in at least two, but fewer than all-but-one of the elections they were eligible in\n    -   **rarely/never**: respondent voted in 0 or 1 of the elections they were eligible in\n\nYou can read in the data directly from the GitHub repo:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(nnet)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(emmeans)\nlibrary(ggeffects)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(parameters)\nlibrary(easystats)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvoter_data <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/non-voters/nonvoters_data.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Lab\n\n-   The variable `Q30` contains the respondent's political party identification.

All three predictors were significantly associated with voting frequency: party identification, $\\chi^2$ (6) = 171.91, p \\< .001; education, $\\chi^2$ (4) = 252.81, p \\< .001; and age, $\\chi^2$ (2) = 666.41, p \\< .001, $R^2_{mcfadden}$ = .09. The odds of Independents (and those who support other parties or none) voting sporadically (versus rarely or never) were lower. Specifically, independents were  times less likely compared to Democrats,  lower compared to Republicans. Others were 0.4029269 times lower compared to Democrats,  lower compared to Republicans. The odds that Republicans, relative to Democrats, voted sporadically was negligible. The pattern of results is similar when comparing the odds of always voting versus rarely or never voting. Supporters of all other parties in our data had lower odds of always voting compared to Democrats (Independents: OR = 0.6287636; Other: OR = 0.2644773) and Republicans (Independents: OR = 0.6300223; Other: OR = 0.2671353.\n\n> Those with high school and some college education were more likely to rarely vote compared to sporadically vote compared to college educated persons (High School: OR = 0.3719485, p \\< .001) and some college (OR = 0.6893542, p \\< .001) or always (High School: OR = 0.2441433, p \\< .001) and (some college: OR = 0.6511599, *p* \\< .001). Stated a bit differently, college voters were more likely to vote than those with a high school or some college education. We also see that those with some college education vs. High school or less were more likely to sporadically vote (Some College: OR = 1.8515072, *p* \\< .001) or always vote (Some College: OR = 2.667122, p \\< .001) compared to rarely/never vote.\n\n> For each one-year increase in age beyond 52 (the mean), the odds of voting sporadically (versus rarely or never) were 1.05 times higher (p \\< .001) relative to the baseline voter. They were 1.06 times higher for always voting (versus rarely or never).\n",
